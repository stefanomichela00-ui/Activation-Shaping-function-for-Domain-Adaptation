# Activation-Shaping-function-for-Domain-Adaptation

In  the  evolving  landscape  of  deep  learning,  the  chal-
lenge of domain adaptation remains a critical issue,  par-
ticularly in the context of image classification tasks.  This
study  introduces  a  novel  approach  to  mitigate  the  effects
of domain shift through the use of activation shaping tech-
niques applied to the ResNet-18 convolutional neural net-
work. By modifying activation maps within the network, we
explored two main strategies: the application of random ac-
tivation maps and the implementation of unsupervised do-
main adaptation.
